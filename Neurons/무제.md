전반적인 설명

Amazon Personalize is an AWS ML application service that provides pre-built algorithms for building personalized recommendations based on user behavior, demographic information, and other contextual data. It allows retail companies to deliver relevant product recommendations to customers in real-time, and can handle large datasets with high accuracy and scalability. Other answers: Amazon SageMaker is an AWS ML application service that provides a fully-managed environment to build, train, and deploy machine learning models, but may not be the best fit for real-time predictions for product recommendations. Amazon Forecast is an AWS ML application service that provides pre-built algorithms for time-series forecasting and may be useful for predicting future product demand, but it may not be the best fit for predicting the likelihood of a customer purchasing a particular product. Amazon Fraud Detector is an AWS ML application service that provides pre-built algorithms for detecting fraud in transactions, but it may not be directly applicable to the use case of predicting customer product purchases. Amazon Machine Learning is an older AWS ML application service that provides pre-built algorithms for classification, regression, and anomaly detection, but has been deprecated and replaced by newer services like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Personalize.
