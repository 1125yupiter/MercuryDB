전반적인 설명

AWS Glue is a fully-managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue can automatically discover and categorize your data, generate and edit ETL code to transform your data, and manage metadata tables for your data sources. With AWS Glue, you can run ETL jobs in a serverless Spark environment, and use crawlers to automatically infer schemas and populate a metadata catalog for Amazon S3 data stores. While AWS Glue has tight integration with Amazon S3, it can also be used with a variety of other data sources, including JDBC databases, Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, and more.
