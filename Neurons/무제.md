A company is planning an employee retention strategy to reduce replacement costs. The company hires a Machine Learning Specialist to develop an ML-based solution to tell whether a current employee will leave or stay for the next 6 months. The ML Specialist was given full access to labeled datasets.

How should the specialist accomplish this task?

Use an Anomaly detection model type

Use a Reinforcement Learning model type

답변이 옳습니다

Use a Classification model type

Use a Linear Regression model type

전반적인 설명

The process of training an ML model involves providing an ML algorithm with training data to learn from. The term ML model refers to the model artifact that is created by the training process. The training data must contain the correct answer, which is known as a target or target attribute. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the training data that map the input data attributes to the target (the answer that you want to predict), and it outputs an ML model that captures these patterns.

Amazon ML supports three types of ML models:

1. **Binary Classification Model** - ML models for binary classification problems predict a binary outcome (one of two possible classes). To train binary classification models, Amazon ML uses the industry-standard learning algorithm known as logistic regression.

2. **Multiclass Classification Model** - ML models for multiclass classification problems allow you to generate predictions for multiple classes (predict one of more than two outcomes). For training multiclass models, Amazon ML uses the industry-standard learning algorithm known as multinomial logistic regression.

3. **Regression Model** - ML models for regression problems predict a numeric value. For training regression models, Amazon ML uses the industry-standard learning algorithm known as linear regression.

The type of model you should choose depends on the type of target that you want to predict.

Classification is a task that requires the utilization of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a particular class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example for this particular model is classifying emails as “_spam_” or “_not spam_.”

Examples of classification problems include:

- Given an example, classify if it is spam or not.
    
- Given a handwritten character, classify it as one of the known characters.
    
- Given recent user behavior, classify as churn or not.
    

Classification is the most suitable model type for the given task since you have to categorize employees into two groups — "stay" or "leave" which is actually a type of Binary Classification Model as it predicts a binary outcome (one of two possible classes).

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use a Classification model type.**

The option that says: **Use a Reinforcement Learning model type** is incorrect because Reinforcement Learning is more suited for solving problems in which an agent can make autonomous decisions. This is a type of learning that is based on interaction with the environment and is used by an agent that must learn the behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The goal of this model is to maximize the long-term rewards that the agent receives as a result of its actions.

The option that says: **Use a Linear Regression model type** is incorrect. Although this could also do the task with some workaround, Regression always outputs a number — it won't directly classify objects like a Classification model type would. The Regression model type is typically used to predict a numeric value. Remember that the primary goal in the scenario is just to know if a particular employee will leave or stay for the next 6 months.

The option that says: **Use an Anomaly detection model type** is incorrect because this model type is typically used for spotting abnormal behaviors and therefore not relevant to the scenario. The identification of anomalous items can be used for detecting errors. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations, and exceptions.
