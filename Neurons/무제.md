You have developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for an e-commerce company, and you need to deploy the model to process new data in real-time. Which of the following AWS services would be the best fit for this use case?

Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform

AWS Lambda

Amazon SageMaker Neo

전반적인 설명

Amazon SageMaker Endpoints is the best fit for this use case. Endpoints allow you to deploy your machine learning models as a RESTful API, enabling you to process incoming requests in real-time. This service is specifically designed for real-time inference, and you can configure an endpoint to use the required instance types. Endpoints automatically scale the number of instances based on the incoming traffic, ensuring high availability and low latency. Other answers: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to events. While Lambda can be used to deploy machine learning models, it is not ideal for real-time inference with low latency. Amazon SageMaker Neo is a service that enables you to optimize machine learning models for specific hardware platforms. While Neo can improve the inference speed and efficiency, it is not designed for real-time inference. Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform is a service that allows you to process data in batch mode by running a batch transform job. Batch Transform is ideal for processing large amounts of data, but it is not designed for real-time inference.
