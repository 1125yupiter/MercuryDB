전반적인 설명

To provide a highly available and fault-tolerant solution for connectivity between an Amazon VPC and an on-premises data center, it is recommended to use a VPN connection with multiple VPN tunnels and redundant customer gateway devices in the on-premises data center. This ensures that if a customer gateway device or VPN tunnel fails, traffic can be automatically rerouted to another customer gateway device or VPN tunnel, without impacting application availability.
