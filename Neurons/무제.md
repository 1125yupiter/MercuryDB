전반적인 설명

For detecting faces in an image and comparing them with a known set of faces, you can use the SearchFaces feature of Amazon Rekognition. This feature allows you to create a collection of faces, and then search for matching faces within an image. The other options, such as DetectLabels, DetectText, DetectFaces, and RecognizeCelebrities, are not suitable for this task.
