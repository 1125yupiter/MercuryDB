None of the above

Increase the number of training samples

전반적인 설명

Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and it starts to learn the noise in the data. This results in a model that performs very well on the training data, but poorly on the testing data. One way to address this problem is to use regularization techniques, which constrain the model to reduce its complexity and prevent it from overfitting the data. Decreasing the regularization parameter will reduce the strength of the constraint, allowing the model to have more flexibility and potentially reduce overfitting. Increasing the number of training samples can also help, but it may not always be feasible. Decreasing the dropout rate or increasing the learning rate may actually exacerbate the problem of overfitting. Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/regularization.html
